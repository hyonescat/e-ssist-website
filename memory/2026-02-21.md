# 2026-02-21 - Major Progress: Operations House & OpenClaw Upgrade

## 🎉 Accomplishments

### 1. Operations House Created
Added 2 critical coordination agents to the roster:
- **👑 Lelouch** (project-coordination) - Orchestrates multi-agent projects
- **👻 Kuroko** (validation) - Quality gates and output validation

**New roster total: 23 agents**
- 🎨 Design House: 9 agents
- 💻 Software House: 9 agents  
- ⚙️ Hardware Lab: 3 agents
- 👑 Operations: 2 agents (NEW)

### 2. Research Reports Completed
Three comprehensive analyses by subagents:
- **SDLC Framework** (Armin) - 5-phase project lifecycle system
- **Quality Control Analysis** (Kurapika) - Identified tool errors, context loss patterns
- **Agent Gap Analysis** (Shikamaru) - Found 6 missing roles, prioritized 4

### 3. OpenClaw Upgrade to 2026.2.3
- Updated from 54ddbc466 → b703ea367 (4253 commits)
- **Theme broke** due to API changes (`formatAgo` removed)
- **Fixed** by replacing with `formatRelativeTimestamp`
- UI rebuilt and deployed successfully
- GitHub backup updated with compatibility fix

### 4. GitHub Repository Updated
- https://github.com/hyonescat/Nyx
- All agent configs backed up
- UI theme files with upgrade fixes
- Restore script tested and working

## 🔧 Technical Fixes

### Theme Compatibility Fix
```typescript
// Old (broken in 2026.2.3)
import { formatAgo } from "../format.ts";
formatAgo(timestamp)

// New (working)
import { formatRelativeTimestamp } from "../format.ts";
formatRelativeTimestamp(timestamp)
```

### Files Modified
- `/opt/openclaw/ui/src/ui/views/agents.ts` - Fixed import and function calls
- Theme restore script now handles this automatically

## 📋 Next Steps (From Research)

### Phase 1: Critical (Done ✅)
- ✅ Lelouch (project coordination)
- ✅ Kuroko (validation)

### Phase 2: High Priority
- ⏳ Itachi (strategic planning)
- ⏳ Kurisu (documentation)

### Phase 3: Future
- Client communication agent
- Maintenance agent

## 🎯 Testing Lelouch
Ready to test the new orchestration flow:
1. Nyx receives project request
2. Spawns Lelouch to coordinate
3. Lelouch spawns house agents as needed
4. Kuroko validates outputs
5. Status reported back to user

## 💡 Key Insights

**From Quality Analysis:**
- 32% of errors are tool configuration issues
- 24% are file access without existence checks
- Validation agent (Kuroko) will catch these pre-delivery

**From Gap Analysis:**
- Strong production capability (21 agents)
- Weak operational infrastructure (now fixed with Operations House)
- Need strategic planning and documentation agents next
